# Hand-Sign-Language-Translator
This is a hand sign language translator for English Alphabet. The model it uses, has been trained using Orange and embedded in its program. Python Flask has been used to create the application. This is the first time I have created an app using Python for backend. I have obviously used HTML and CSS for styling.
